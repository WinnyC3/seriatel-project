## Data Processing 
- We checked for missing values, duplicates, categorical and numerical values to ensure that data is clean and in correct formaat for modelling.
- We further removed the class imbalance from the data and standardize to make date Consistent and uniformity of modelling.
- This was done to ensured that the data is valid,accurate and complete for modelling. 
- The chart shows heatmap for feature selection and relatuionship understanding.
